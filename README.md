# 🧠 AI-Native Code Editor & Developer Platform

A next-generation, cross-platform code editor built from the ground up for speed, introspection, and modularity. Powered by Rust, React, and Tauri, this project reimagines the developer experience by fusing native performance with real-time browser automation, terminal access, and extensible architecture.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Modern editors like VS Code and Zed have made huge strides—but they’re still constrained by legacy architecture (Electron, plugin bottlenecks, IPC latency). This project breaks free from those limitations by:

- **Eliminating Electron**: No Chromium UI overhead. Native windowing via Tauri.
- **Streaming Browser Logs Natively**: Direct CDP integration for real-time console, network, and runtime events.
- **Integrating Native Terminals**: PTY sessions with full lifecycle control.
- **Optimizing for Performance**: Lower RAM/CPU usage, faster startup, and minimal latency.
- **Architecting for Extensibility**: Modular React components + Rust commands = plugin-ready foundation.

This isn’t just an editor—it’s a **developer platform** built for the AI-native era.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 🧠 Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Rust via Tauri
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Editor Core**: CodeMirror 6

### 🌐 Browser Log Streaming
- Launches Chrome/Chromium in isolated app mode
- Connects directly to Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
- Streams all browser events (console, network, runtime) in real time

### 🖥️ Terminal Integration
- Native PTY sessions with shell detection
- Scalable session management and pooling
- Robust error handling and diagnostics

### 📁 File Management
- Native file open/save/browse via Tauri
- Fast, secure, and cross-platform

## ⚙️ Industry Impact

This project sets a new standard for developer tools:

- **Performance-first**: Rust backend and native UI outperform Electron-based editors.
- **Observability-native**: Real-time browser introspection enables debugging, automation, and AI workflows.
- **Modular by design**: Built to support plugins, agents, and collaborative features without architectural rewrites.
- **Cross-platform parity**: Works seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It’s ideal for:
- AI-powered development environments
- Web automation and testing workflows
- Terminal-heavy engineering setups
- Teams seeking lightweight, extensible tooling
